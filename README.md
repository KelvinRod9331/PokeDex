#Background
During my time in school I was given a simple task, to utilize the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) to display a flavor text of just five pokemon, but I felt it was too easy. The Pokeapi has over 800+ pokemon to use from and it had so much valuable information that I thought to my self, why not recreate the Poke'dex and make it fun for anyone who wants to use it, thus my Poke'dex project was born.

#Features

You can:
* Click on any pokemon from the list provided.
* Click on the buttons to display the information you want.
* Capture a pokemon and add it to an inventory.
* Click on "Next" or "Prev" to go back and fourth.
* Use voice commands to search for a pokemon by clicking on the record button.
* You can cancel any requests.

# Installation

1. To get started you can git clone or download the repository.
2. You Will Have To npm install packages included in the JSON file by typing ```npm install ``` on your cmd 
3. **YOU MUST ADD** the `p5.speech.js` file into p5 `node_module` folder. This will allow the text-to-voice and voice-to-text feature to function. This is the route `pokedex/node_modules/p5/lib/addons`.
4. Type ```npm start``` once you have completed step 1-4
5. YOU MUST HAVE INTERNET SERVICE To Run The API being used to Fetch Data
